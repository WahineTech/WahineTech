# WahineTech

Welcome to "Manoa Fitness Finder" an web applciation developed for an ICS 314 project by one of our members. We
 decided to use this web application for our ICS 427 project and modified it to meet the
 Software Quality
 Assurance standards. 
 <br>
 
 This web application was designed to allow UH Manoa students and faculty to create an account and
  set up
  their profiles to include information about themselves and their interest. From there, the application would allow
   users to match with other users who have similar interest and they can connect with eachother. <br> 
   
   Our goal is to improve the security and privacy for this web application since it deals with a lot of personal
    data.
